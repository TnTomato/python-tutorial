Python Tutorial
===============

This is an easy tutorial for primary Python developer. If you are new to
Python, feel free to learn python and have a nice time here. Or if you are an
old hand, just feel free to attack me!

This tutorial is based on my own learning path. After finishing all chapters,
you will be able to build any easy python project on your own.

Python is easy to learn but difficult to master. As a very beginner, it's vital
to consolidate the foundation. For further consideration, the more solid the
foundation is, the higher you stand, the farther you see.

Tips: Clone this repo and run any example.
