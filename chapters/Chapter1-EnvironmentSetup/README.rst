Environment Setup
=================

The first step of learning a programming language is environment setup.
In this case, we choose to develop on Windows 10 and use Python 3.8.

About IDE, `Pycharm`_ is recommended for both green hands and old hands.

Python Interpreter Installation
-------------------------------

First of all, turn to the browser and visit `the official site of Python`_,
click the ``Download`` button in the navigation bar, and select a specific
version of Python to download(Python 3.8 is recommended). Then finish your
installation according to the guide of the installer.

After finishing the installation, you can type ``python --version`` on CMD.
It shows like:

.. code-block:: text

    ~\python-tutorial\Chapter1-EnviornmentSetup>python --version
    Python 3.8.0

You can see a simple example in `first.py`_. Use ``python first.py`` to try
to run your first Python code:

.. code-block:: text

    ~\python-tutorial\Chapter1-EnviornmentSetup>python first.py
    Hello world!
