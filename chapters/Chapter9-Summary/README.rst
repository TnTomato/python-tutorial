Summary
=======

Look back all the chapters. We started from Python's environment setup, to some
programming skills. You've learned how to declare variables. You've learned how
to use operators. You've learned how to build conditional statements and loop
statements. You've learned to define functions and classes, and how to use them
properly in a module or a package. Try to link all you've learned, you will be
able to code with ease. Of course these are not all what Python has. Python is
kind of a progamming language that is easy to learn but hard to master. You do
some light learning on it, then you can come to a solution to some simple tasks.
But if you treat Python as a major, a job or even a dream, you have to dig
deeper. What you have to do is not only Python, but also beyond Python.

The tutorial series seems to be finished. You've nearly got all the basic
knowledge of Python. But hold on! Nobody tells it's going to come to an end.
It's just a very beginning.

I'm not a teacher. I'm a learner too. Keep learning make you stronger. Don't
make yourself easy and comfortable. Never too late to learn.
